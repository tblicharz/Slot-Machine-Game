In this project, I developed a slot machine game using Python. The game enables players to deposit virtual cash, place bets on a customizable number of lines, specify their betting amount, track their winnings, monitor their current balance, and cash out at any time. The code incorporates various programming concepts, including functions, anonymous variables, the splat operator, and logic implementation for managing rows, columns, and nested lists.
